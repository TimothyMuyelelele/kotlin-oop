   /* Object Oriented Programming OOP
   *   => Description:- Is  a programming paradigm based on the concept of classes and objects and is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprint-(classes) which are used to create individual instances of objects.
 *Class-is a blueprint of an object to be created in a program.
 * Object -it is an instance of a class created with specific data.
 *        An object consists of :-
 *                               1.Identity -> Give a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with another.
 *                               2.Attribute-> This is the state or properties of an object.(Characteristics)
 *                               3.Behaviour -> Is the response of an object to another object.
 * SYNTAX OF CLASS -
 *    class class name (){//Class header..
 *                       //properties
 *                     // member function
 *
 *                          }
   *  ENTITIES OF OOP
   * 1.Inheritance - it is the mechanism by which an object acquires some or all properties of another object
   * 2.Polymorphism - means to process object differently based on their data type.i.e:one method with multiple implementation for a certain class of action
   * 3.Encapsulation - is binding the data with code that manipulates it.It keeps the data and the code safe from external interference.
   * 4.Abstraction - is the process where you show relevant data and hide unnecessary details of an object from the user.
